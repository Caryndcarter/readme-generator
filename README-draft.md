# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was done in order to make it easy to save your own recipes to a personalized online recipe book. You are given three recipes to start, and you can add as many custom recipes as you want. These custom recipes will be added to the home screen and saved in your browser for future reference. After creating a recipe, you can click on it on the home page to view it, and from here delete the recipe or even add a random ingredient to shake things up. We hope you enjoy using our custom recipe book!

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

### How To Add a New Recipe
If you want to add your own recipe, find the navigation link in the top-right of the screen that says "Add Recipe" and click on it. You will be redirected to a form where you can fill out the details of the recipe you are adding.
1. First, you will be able to fill out basic information about the recipe. You can give your recipe a title and description, list how many servings the recipe makes, indicate how long the recipe takes to make, and even enter an image link to be associated with the recipe. To add a custom image, you will first have to upload your desired picture to Imgur or a similar image hosting website. After that, you will need to copy the image address of the image and paste that link into the form before submitting the recipe basics
